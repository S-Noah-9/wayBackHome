          <a>Michael would take Train #1 which would take the normal route as usual. However, it took him 2 hours and 40 minutes. Once he have arrived, he got out of the train station and therefore, would take walk back home. By the time he got back, it's now 7:10 pm so he somehow arrived 40 minutes late.</a>
