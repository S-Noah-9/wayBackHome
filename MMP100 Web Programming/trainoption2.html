          <a>When Michael chose Train #2, he would somehow took the fastest train route than Train #1. Especially when the train arrived at the arrival's time, he would take it anyway. He took him a short time to arrived and once he finally arrived at his stop, he would take the scenery back home after that train ride. Once he arrived at his home, it's now 6:30pm, which he woujld make it as his arrival time. As long he's not late, he still have reach back home safely. </a>
